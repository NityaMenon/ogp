## Distributing  instantaneous COVID-19 updates in times of uncertainty

When COVID-19 first hit Singapore, there was a significant amount of false information spreading around the country, creating anxiety and uncertainty among citizens. As a result, government agencies had to look for a way to disseminate accurate and up-to-date information to citizens via channels they could easily access. 

In 3 days, we built a mass communication tool, [Postman](/products/postman/), which enabled the government to send nationwide COVID-19 updates through the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel. Now a modular omni-channel communication tool, Postman has enabled agencies to quickly scale their communication needs and allowed them to distribute critical information across multiple channels such as email, SMS, and Telegram.

In addition, [Isomer](/products/isomer/) was used to build website pages for COVID-19 campaigns such as [sgunited.gov.sg](https://sgunited.gov.sg) and [safetravel.ica.gov.sg](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg). Instead of having to wait months as is typical for government procurement, Isomer allowed government agencies to build these websites in as little as  1.5 days, ensuring that citizens receive the latest information about the constantly evolving COVID-19 situation.

Lastly, [Go.gov.sg](/products/gogovsg/) has been used by government agencies to shorten important COVID-19 related links such as  COVID-19 press releases, application forms, and more. As the official government link shortener, Go.gov.sg has allowed citizens to easily access important information without the risk of phishing through the use of a legitimate .gov.sg domain.
