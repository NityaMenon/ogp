accomplishments:
  - I set up and wrote content for the official PaySG guide website to provide
    users with a seamless navigation experience. This website empowers users to
    onboard onto PaySG independently, without requiring any additional guidance,
    and created the content for the new PaySG landing page.
  - I proactively contribute to design decisions, providing recommendations and
    guidelines to the designer. I have also created a UX writing guide and
    checklist for PaySG, serving as a reference for designers and team members
    when writing content.
  - I worked with engineers to come up with quick prototypes for features such
    as QR code download and new payment service table, and introduced Linear to
    the PaySG team as a tool to streamline our project management process.
