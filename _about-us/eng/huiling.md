accomplishments:
  - I developed our Template Builder’s highly-requested “Family Table” and
    “Expenses Table”, which are “auto-fill” tables – admin users select which
    data columns they wish to include in the table, and when generating a
    document for the template, data is automatically filled in for the
    respective columns based on the patient / financial application
  - "I was a main engineer on the development and/or testing of a couple of
    important integrations, such as: batch sending of NeFR PLS data, pulling of
    MTCH & MTLTC data, and integration with various external systems for a new
    FAS fund"
  - I worked on an “App Configuration” page and new backend module – this
    allowed OGP users to update our banner via the frontend, and was designed
    for extensibility into feature flagging, migrating between feature v1 and
    v2, etc. (now used daily by engineers and ProdOps!)
