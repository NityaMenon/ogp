    LetterSG, OurStory, ExploreSG, Office Funds Pool
  - Despite coming from different technical background I was able improve my
    React/JS/HTML/CSS skills in the first couple of weeks/months to the point
    where I was able to solve a prevalent UI bug that the rest of the
    engineering team had given up on already.
  - I am proud (and happy that this is possible) that my feedback on org-wide
    issues was heard and was shared with the wider organisation.
