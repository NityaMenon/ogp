accomplishments:
  - Through investing time in building context on 10+ products and relationships
    with 40+ people, I'm at a point where I'm able to effectively support a
    large part of the OGP organisation
  - I helped set up SGC for success by incrementally transferring over resources
    that were of strategic importance as they built out the platform
  - I've helped to more clearly define the EM and TLM roles within the context
    of OGP, through 1-1 coaching, writing short "one-pager" guides to more
    clearly articulate ideas, making team process adjustments and supporting
    frequent org communications
quote: I love technology because of its ability to solve problems, and at OGP I
  get to work on problems that really matter.
