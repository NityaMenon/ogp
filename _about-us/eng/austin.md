accomplishments:
  - Scoping and building Bright MVP within a month, launching it within a month
    and onboarding all AIC staff within 3 months. Bright entirely replaced their
    manual and inefficient workflow with excel sheets and reduced search times
    from an average of 20 minutes to under 3 minutes
  - Shipped Bright which allowed AIC staff to focus on other aspects of their
    social work. Our users were all happy with the product and appreciative of
    the work done (we have an average rating of 4.3/5.0)
  - Helping Care360 launch to all PHIs in Singapore. Having been part of the
    initial Care360 team, it was great to finally launch our product to all
    hospitals in Singapore within a short amount of time
