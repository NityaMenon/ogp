jobTitle: Lead Software Engineer
curProducts:
  - Primary Care
pastProducts: []
accomplishments:
  - I managed to grow my seniors to lead projects without me injecting myself so
    much in it, grew my other engineers to properly scale up as seniors and not
    to fall up (i.e. promoted without sufficient skill), and managed to start
    new projects (or at least prototype) successfully
  - I managed to push efforts on increasing HAS brand awareness, and implement
    some processes fairly well to address the highest pain points & improve the
    team to certain level of productivity
  - Setting higher standard for the team as what's considered good (code
    quality, engineering practices, UI & UX)
