accomplishments:
  - As the team has grown significantly over the past 6 months, I've helped to
    maintain the good culture but also improve on the processes that enabled us
    to build really good products that is well-loved by the team itself,
    stakeholders, POHs and most importantly, the public
  - As a technical engineering manager, I have worked to form a deep
    understanding of every product engineering system. I have also worked to
    form a deep understanding every engineers work which has enabled me to
    provide mentorship and leadership across Fin-Scam. I have tried to
    demonstrate and be a good role model to what a engineer in OGP can become
  - I have worked closely with the existing teams and manager to get a good
    understanding of the current status and deficiencies in the product and
    teams. I have then helped to revamp the engineering processes and hired or
    assigned engineers who will be best suited to be working on those teams.
    This involved 1-1s with all members of previous teams, studying the existing
    systems and code-bases and also working with the PM and Design functions in
    these teams to set up a new working team and culture
quote: At OGP, I have the space and autonomy to build any product that will
  improve the lives of people in Singapore
