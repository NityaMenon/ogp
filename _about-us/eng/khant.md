accomplishments:
  - I was responsible for building the search service from the ground up and had
    full ownership of the service development from clarifying requirements, and
    designing infrastructure to building UI and setting up a monitoring system
    for it. The system has been running since the beta launch with little to no
    service disturbance
  - I worked closely with our PM on product requirements, planned the
    engineering requirements/technical specifications, designed the backend API,
    and re-designed our data ingestion pipeline to integrate SGDRM which I wrote
    for tabular data validation and reporting data ingestion status
  - I designed a logging module for our new project that will pass a unique ID
    across different application layers which allows engineers to easily debug
    the issue across different AWS services. I also set up an engineering
    dashboard on DataDog that monitors our infrastructure and gives a good
    overview of how the systems are performing
