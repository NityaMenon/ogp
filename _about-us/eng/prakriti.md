accomplishments:
  - "LetterSG UI Revamp: One of the most significant accomplishments in the past
    cycle was my contribution to multiple LetterSG UI revamps. This initiative
    required extensive cross-functional collaboration (XFN) and close
    partnership with our design team. Through dedicated teamwork and rigorous
    bug bash sessions, we successfully delivered a polished product. This
    accomplishment not only improved the user experience but also showcased my
    ability to work effectively in a collaborative environment, ensuring that
    our final product met high-quality standards"
  - "Onboarding to LetterSG Codebase: Another achievement I'm proud of is my
    rapid onboarding to the LetterSG codebase. I quickly became proficient in
    navigating and contributing to this complex codebase. This allowed me to
    independently develop and ship multiple features, such as email integration,
    QR code, password instructions, etc which greatly benefited our live users.
    This accomplishment demonstrates my adaptability and technical skills in
    delivering valuable additions to our product"
  - "Resolving GoGovSg Memory Limit Issue: A notable accomplishment in the past
    cycle was my work on resolving infrastructure issues, particularly those
    related to memory limits being exceeded. This was a challenging task,
    especially considering it was my first time working extensively on
    infrastructure-related matters. However, I'm proud to say that I was able to
    resolve the issue independently and reach a scalable solution. This
    achievement highlights my ability to learn and adapt to new technical
    challenges while providing critical support to ensure the stability and
    reliability of our systems"
