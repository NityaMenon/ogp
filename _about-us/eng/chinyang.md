pastProducts: []
accomplishments:
  - Quickly ramped up from having no experience in modern full stack
    development, to a level where I have the ability to design and implement a
    feature end-to-end, diagnose and address any issues across the full stack
    (including AWS, Cloudflare, etc.), and contribute to technical discussions
    and team technical growth
  - In an engineering team of 2, implemented Pair Chat, an LLM application which
    has grown to more than 15000 users in a couple of months. This was done
    while working in a very new field with no established best tools/practices.
    This presented extra difficulties in terms of data security and user
    education, and required a great deal of independent learning and
    self-direction
  - Independently performed exploration work in the very new areas of autonomous
    agents and document-augmented LLMs, which informed product feature
    decisions. As part of this, I implemented Pair Studio + Pair Documents
    (backend), a new feature in Pair Chat that allows for the creation and
    sharing of custom document augmented LLM chat bots (currently in beta with
    workshop testing). This was even more cutting edge, and I was not able to
    leverage existing solutions for it, but had to implement and iterate on the
    indexing and retrieval strategies for it to arrive at a working solution
