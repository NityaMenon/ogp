curProducts:
  - Primary Care
pastProducts:
  - Covid Ops
  - Healthtech
  - Queue
  - PaySG
  - Parking.sg
accomplishments:
  - Exploration of methods to engage new and existing clinics to onboard onto
    HAS and Queue; this includes creating marketing collaterals from scratch and
    getting clinics to participate in an incentivised user trial. By doing this,
    I had to learn new tools e.g Canva, Figma, creating proposals, raising AORs
    and hiring of vendors
  - Defining prod ops work for Queue and HAS outreach and stepping up to
    coordinate with partner agencies to reach a goal; I am stepping out of my
    shell to take the lead as my forte has been in execution instead of planning
  - Participating and organising in roadshows/events to have real time
    engagement with members of the public to better understand what works (or
    not) with our products
quote: __A ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.__
  Being continually pushed to explore new depths for work and myself has made me
  learn so much about what I am capable of.
