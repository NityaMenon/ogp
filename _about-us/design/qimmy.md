accomplishments:
  - Dealing with uncertainty to deliver meaningful outcomes for MySkillsFuture
    project—Taking on a brand new engagement that came out of a brown bag
    session means being comfortable with ambiguity and finding clarity where
    there is none
  - Showed how rapid experimentation and iterative concept testing can provide
    valuable insights and give stakeholders the confidence to drive product
    improvements
  - Being a versatile contributor to the team—Moving from the smallest (SSG) to
    one of the biggest team in OGP (Care360) really pushed me to switch between
    working independently and collaboratively with others
