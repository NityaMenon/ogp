accomplishments:
  - I finished an entire IA and content revamp for the isomer website and guide!
    By working closely with product ops (and a lot of writing), content is now
    much cleaner and clearer, and provides a better onboarding experience with
    clearer expectations. Plus, the site looks good now
  - Getting site launch into a visual workflow and feature for users was
    difficult since itâ€™s a very technical and invisible backend process. But by
    working closely with my engineer and product ops, we came up with a user
    flow that works and is already in testing
  - I made big brain animation prototypes in Figma for NLB products! Making
    these required a lot of testing and learning how Figma prototypes work. I
    feel like I got better at doing it and am glad that the prototypes worked
    well to communicate my vision
