    writing JD, interview guides, screening, scheduling, interviewing), leading
    to most of our new hires this year
  - Spread out impact across other projects – designing StarterApp, mapping
    Finance DC flow, running Report Card interviews, Design System onboarding,
    running HTF workshop, ad-hoc CalSG IA work. All this helped to push other
