accomplishments:
  - I led the design efforts for the initial launch of PaySG in just three
    weeks, incorporating feedback from eight usability tests (UTs) and
    continuously improving the design to achieve a current user rating of 4.69
    (out of 547 reviews) for the payment experience, with a 57% payment rate,
    totaling $2.9 million paid across 7.1k transactions. This demonstrates the
    effectiveness and efficiency of my contributions during this intense design
    and research period
  - I designed the beta version of EventSG in August, utilizing only one-third
    of my effort. The design was based on Hackathon 2023 for EngageSG, resulting
    in a total of 98 events trialed since the launch, highlighting the
    significant impact of this endeavor
  - I played a pivotal role in enhancing the dashboard and citizen letter
    designs for LetterSG within a span of two weeks, including onboarding. This
    demonstrates my ability to contribute effectively and autonomously during
    challenging times, requiring minimal guidance and onboarding
