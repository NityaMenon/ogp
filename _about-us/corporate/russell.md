  - Launched OGP Profile Pages to publicly celebrate the work of every OGP
    officer over the time they spend with us

    greenlight a groundbreaking trial of applicant tracking systems to improve
    government hiring
  - Conceptualised and worked with other OGP members to run several initiatives
    to celebrate public impact of OGP officers' work (Wall of Good) as well as
    keep OGP officers continually connected to the public we serve to better
    understand problems and opportunities (OGP volunteering, OGP

quote: I joined OGP in 2019, and have stayed since then because I think it is
  the governmentâ€™s best shot today at breaking the mould on trying new ways for
  government organisations to work better, so that we can be a better public
  service.
