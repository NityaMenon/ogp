#### What motivated you to build this product?
Fun. We thought, how great would it be if we had a Year in Review slideshow for civic contributions?

#### Why was design the most challenging part?
The format we chose was a character walking through a series of scenes. This involved a large amount of illustration work from designers.

#### Fun facts!
**One interesting finding:**\\
We actually spent a fair bit of time analysing illustrations online to understand what made an illustrated scene emotionally impactful.

**One thing you'd have done differently:**\\
Probably chosen the scenes a bit better and less based on the survey results

**Others:**\\
Big thanks to everyone who participated in our initial survey and collaborated with us!
