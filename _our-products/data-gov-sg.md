### Open repository for Singapore’s public data 

#### Background 

In line with Singapore’s vision to be a smart nation, data.gov.sg was launched in 2011 as a repository of data collected by 70 public agencies made accessible openly and freely to citizens and developers, with the aim of co-creating useful solutions. APIs to real-time public data are also provided to aid the development of mobile and web applications.  

#### Solution
data.gov.sg helps citizens and laymen better understand public data by providing interactive dashboards, visualisations and articles in the current iteration of the product.

* Dashboards & data visualisations allow users to intuitively understand public data without needing to be a data scientist
* Automatic data standard validation ensures datasets are usable and interoperable
* Search and data previews improve discoverability and accessibility of the datasets

#### Impact

* 350,000 monthly visitors
* 30,000 data downloads
* 13 million API calls
