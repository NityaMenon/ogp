### The trusted voucher system for the Singapore Government

#### Background 

RedeemSG is the national voucher system that digitizes, simplifies and reduces inefficiencies faced by campaign organizers, merchants and recipients involved in managing or participating in a campaign. RedeemSG is used for the nationwide CDC Voucher Scheme.


#### Solution
RedeemSG provides a simple and digital solution that solves the inefficiencies and costs involved in paper voucher schemes, while remaining inclusive for the entire nation.

* Recipients can sign up and claim vouchers without needing to download a mobile app

* Merchants can accept vouchers easily using the RedeemSG Merchant app.

* Agencies can manage voucher campaign(s) and track redemptions using the RedeemSG admin portal.




#### Impact

* Enabled > 20 million redemptions since April 2020 across 10 national campaigns, including the nation-wide CDC voucher scheme, and mask and SG Together pack distribution
* S$1 million claimed by households for the CDC Voucher Scheme
* 12500+ merchants and hawkers on board
* 1400+ volunteers enabled
* Integrated > 1.1 thousand vending machines integrated

* Mr Chris Liang, 27, a second-generation hawker who just took over his family's seafood business at Chong Pang Market, is [optimistic that the voucher scheme will boost sales](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/over-1-million-sporean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-over-28m-spent).

>"Having to deal with fresh seafood and other wet items, it was inconvenient for me to receive physical vouchers. We can now easily scan the digital vouchers... and receive the payout the next day," he said.

* "We are greatly heartened that Singaporeans are rallying behind and supporting our heartland hawkers and merchants by spending over [$28 million worth of vouchers to date](https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/over-million-singaporean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-over-28m-spent)," said Mayor Low Yen Ling
