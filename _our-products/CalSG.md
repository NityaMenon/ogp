### CalSG: Appointment bookings for Government

#### Background 
Public officers often need to manage appointment scheduling, especially if their job involves public-facing ops or organising events. We found that many such officers use FormSG to let people book appointments.

But while FormSG offers great form-building capabilities, it does not allow you to limit the number of people who can book a particular time slot. Frequently, slots would be overbooked and the officer in charge would have to manually deconflict them via email.

We wanted to provide an easy way for public officers to collect appointment bookings.


#### Solution

CalSG allows public officers to:
* Specify dates and times which are available to be booked
* Customise the form which attendees fill in when they book appointments
* Share a link via which time slots can be booked by attendees
* Send custom email confirmations to attendees, including links to reschedule or cancel their appointments
* View booked appointments by date, or download an Excel sheet of booked appointments for a range of dates


#### Impact

Within 3 months of launch,
* Handled over 10,000 appointment bookings
* Onboarded over 1,000 users
