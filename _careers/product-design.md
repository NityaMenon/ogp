### **What does a Product Designer do?**
As a product designer, your job is to make a concrete vision of what a good product looks like. This encompasses understanding users needs and the problems they face, creating intuitive user flows through your application, and polishing detailed aesthetics and understanding how they make users feel.

On a day to day basis, this means:
* Talking with users to understand their problems
* Creating personas, user flows, sketches, and information architectures to guide design decisions
* Building mockups and prototypes to illustrate different design approaches
* Testing early designs with users and iterating on their feedback
* Defining overall aesthetics and visual styles for the product
* Creating detailed user interface specifications
* Guiding engineers in their implementation of your designs

Additionally, more senior designers will be expected to:
* Establish common design standards for the team
* Run design critiques to share your expertise with other designers
* Help with recruiting

Digital services are about improving the way people interact with their government. Getting the subtle details rights is the difference between an intuitive experience and a frustrating one. As we launch new products, your role will be to ensure that the future of public service is not just functional, but delightful to use.

You will work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on peopleâ€™s lives. You will have direct ownership of your work with over 70% of our projects starting as ground up initiatives. Rather than work on commercial ventures commonly found in the startup scene, we're here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

### **Who we are looking for**
We look for people who:

* Have a demonstrated ability to designing products and experiences - Prior work and personal projects count for much more than specific degrees

* Have a great visual design sense and an eye for detail - You should have a portfolio that showcases your prior work and be able to explain your design decisions

* Are passionate about user-centered design - We look for experience with user research processes and an understanding of mobile-first and responsive design

* You need proficiency in Figma and Adobe Creative Suite. Familiarity with HTML/CSS/JS and other web development technologies is a plus

* Communicate well with both users and engineers - You need to be comfortable taking feedback from laymen to inform your designs and then explaining those designs in sufficient detail to engineers for implementation

* Take initiative to make things happen - Our job is to push for change in government, so we need to challenge the status quo and not wait for instruction

* Want to work for the public good - We are public servants, we serve the public. This sometimes means ignoring political pressures and misguided policies. We need people who will push back if something is not in the public interest

Overall we look for people who have ability, initiative, good communication, and strong values.
