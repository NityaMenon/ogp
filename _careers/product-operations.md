> You are responsible for scaling OGP's products to more users. You will play a significant role in maximising the public good each of our products can bring to Singapore and beyond.

### **What does a Product Operations Specialist do?**
A Product Operations Specialist is directly responsible for scaling OGP products to maximise public good by reaching more users and better serving their needs. This involves proactively finding and onboarding new users to OGP products, responding and resolving to questions/issues raised, and channeling feedback and more complex issues to discuss with Product Teams to improve our products. 

At a more senior level, Product Operations Specialists will also be in charge of establishing and running product operation approaches and systems so as to enable OGP product teams to rapidly meet user needs which arise, including any rapid scaling of the user base.

Concretely, this means:
* Proactively identifying and approaching new users (e.g. other government agencies) to maximise public good opportunities of OGP products
* Training and onboarding new users
* Spending time interacting with users by email, chat and phone to support the roll-out and running of OGP products
* Optimising our internal and external documentation to improve customer support. e.g. Product FAQ, customer handling guidebook etc
* Working closely with Product Managers, Engineers and Product Designers across the team to bring unique insights back from users to improve our products
* Identifying and initiating changes to help scale product operations

### **Who we are looking for**
We look for people who:

* Love helping others solve problems
* Have strong written and verbal communication
* Feel comfortable with technical concepts and are able to explain how our Products work to a range of audiences
* Able to empathise with users and quickly grasp the issues theyâ€™re facing
* Enjoy the puzzle of solving open-ended problems
* Are familiar with Google Suite products and Zendesk
* Prior experience in a product operations role (e.g. L2/L3 support, leading Product Oprations functions)
* Written and verbal language skills in common languages spoken in Singapore (e.g. Mandarin, Chinese dialect, Hindi, Tamil, Bahasa Melayu) is a plus

Overall we look for people who have ability, initiative, good communication, and strong values.
