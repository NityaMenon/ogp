### What do we look for in candidates?

Beyond assessing OGP officers against established career schemas, we assess any potential OGP employee on 4 core attributes - Ability, Initiative, Communication, and Values.

#### **Ability** 
_How competent is the individual in their field of expertise?_

Our mission is to build tech for public good. This requires having people who not only care about what they do, but are good at it. We need people who are excellent in each of their fields to come together and contribute toward our mission.

#### **Initiative** 
_How proactive is the individual at pushing for change and solving problems where there are no clear instructions?_

Initiative is a non-negotiable to get things done by pushing for change and solving problems where there aren’t readily available solutions. We need people who have a strong internal drive and are comfortable working in an environment with more problems to be solved than directions to be given.

#### **Communication** 
_How well can the individual talk and reason about their work to others both within and outside their functional area?_

We work in lean, cross-functional teams that require communication within and across officers’ domain of expertise. In pushing for change and working quickly in high-performing teams, we run as well as the poorest communicator in the room. We need people who can communicate well not just to be understood, but to influence and push for change within and beyond OGP.

#### **Values** 
_How much does the individual desire to work on bringing about change for public good?_

We exist to deliver public good through technology. We need all members of our team to get behind our mission and work toward this common goal. We need people who care about working on something beyond themselves, and show this passion for public good through their thoughts and actions.
